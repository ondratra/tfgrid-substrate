# TF Grid db on substrate

## Installation

### Node

You will need a specific version of rust nightly in order to compile:

`rustup install nightly`

Wasm toolchain:

`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly`

Now you can build.

```
cd substrate-node
make build-debug
```

This will build the node binary in release mode, once built you can execute it by doing following:

`./target/release/susbtrate --dev --tmp --ws-external`

> You need the `ws-external` flag in order to connect from a zos node to substrate in a local setup.

### Client

You can use the client to interact with the chain, [read more](./cli-tool/readme.md)

### Graphql (optional)

If you want to query the data inside the blockchain with graphql you can set this up locally.

```
cd graphql

# this installs Volta that provides Node v14 (needed for some OS distribution without proper v14 support)
./setup.sh 

yarn

yarn build

yarn db:up
yarn db:prepare
yarn db:migrate
yarn db:init

docker-compose up
```

Now browse to localhost:4000/graphql

Example query: 

```
query {
    entities(limit: 5) {
        name
    }
}
```
